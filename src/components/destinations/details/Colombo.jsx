                building which houses the presidential secretariat and the
                government secretariat, formally the parliament, almost a
                replica of Whitehall in England.

                with clock tower, a legacy of the British Colonizers for nearly
                100 years. It performed the dual task of being a beacon to ships
                in the Indian Ocean whilst keeping time designed by Lady Ward,
                wife of Governor Sir Henry Ward. It was built in 1857 but
