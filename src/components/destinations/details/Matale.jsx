              <b>Aluvihare rock temple</b>
              <h4>
                This is an ancient rock temple of great significance in history of Buddhism. The Buddhist cannon and its commentaries, which were till then handed down orally, were committed to writing for the first time at Aluvihare temple in 2nd century B.C.
                Folklore has many meanings to the name Aluvihara. One is that the Pali word Aloka was Alu (light) in ancient Sinhala and as it was the abode of Theras, it was a Viharaya. Hence the two words have been coined to make it Aluvihara. Another view is that there is a huge rock, east of the main rock cave, it has not cut off the light. Therefore it was known as the Aloka lena (cave with light).
