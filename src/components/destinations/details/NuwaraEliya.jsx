              <b>Horton Plains</b>
              <h4>
                Horton Plains National Park is a protected area in the central highlands of Sri Lanka and is covered by montane grassland and cloud forest. The Horton Plains are the headwaters of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains. Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains’ vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest, and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals, and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback is one of the major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a natural phenomenon.

              <h4>
                Hakgala Botanical Garden is situated on the Nuwara Eliya - Badulla main road, 16 km from Nuwara Eliya.

Once after the Tea replace the Cinchona, it was turned into an experimental Tea cultivation. In 1884 it transformed into a garden since then many sub - tropical and some temperate plants were planted in the gardens. Now the garden is famous for number of species of Orchids and Roses.
                The climate of the Hakgala area, where the mean temperature is around 16ºC, is perfect for temperate-zone plants, both ornamental and useful. These include conifers and cedars from Australia, Bermuda and Japan, and cypresses from the Himalayas, China and as far as Persia, Mexico and California. New Caledonia gave Hakgala a special variety of pine, and there are specimens of this genus from the Canary Islands as well. An English oak, introduced around 1890, commemorates the “hearts of oak” of Britain’s vaunted sea power. There is also an excellent specimen of the camphor tree, whose habitat is usually in regions above 12,000 m elevation. The fern’s delicate fronds conjure up visions of misty grottoes, lichen-covered stones and meandering streams.
                In the Rose Garden, you can experience the sights and scents of these glorious blooms in their infinite variety. From here it is a short stroll to the exotic sophistication of the Orchid House. A special attraction here is the variety of mountain orchids, many of them endemic to Sri Lanka. The languid low-country lotus and water lily also float in serene loveliness, emerging from a background of floating leaves to evoke the calm of saffron-robed monks, white-clad devotees and flickering oil lamps.

Dense jungles provide a picturesque backdrop behind the vibrant temple. According to Hindu mythology, this is where Princess Seetha was held captive by King Ravana. The bubbly stream is believed to be where Princess Seetha bathed, gushes alongside the temple. The Seetha Amman kovil is a quaint little temple with statues of Rama, Seetha, Hanuman, Lakshmana and Sugriva. Its distinguishing factor is that it is the only Kovil in the world dedicated to the Goddess Seetha.
