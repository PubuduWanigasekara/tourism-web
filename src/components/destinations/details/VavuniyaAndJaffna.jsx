              funnels through bustling Vavuniya. For traveler, a stay here is a
              convenient way to break up a trip from the south to Jaffna.The
              town arcs around an attractive tank that’s best observed from
              kudiyirippu pillaiyar kovil, a Lord Ganesh temple with a very
              ornate, gateway tower and a gold – clad image in its sanctum.
              Vauniyas’ archaeological museum is modest but some of the 10th
              -15th century terracotta figures are delightfully primitive while
              the central hexagonal chamber has some fine 5th to 8th century
              Buddha status in Mannar.

              With towering, rainbow Hindu temples, colorful saw is draped
              effortlessly over on bicycles and warm breezes carrying the sweet
              fragrance of fruit trees, the North is a different world. Here the
              landscape is arid and sun is hot and tough, with coastlines and
              sparking aqua water everywhere.
